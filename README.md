# CS 765 Assignments
This respository contains the three assignments of the "Blockchains, Cryptocurrencies and Smart Contracts" course (CS 765, Spring 2023 offering) at IIT Bombay, under the guidance of [Prof. Vinay Ribeiro](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~vinayr/).

The first assignment involves building a simulator for a bitcoin-style blockchain, with various configuration parameters like the average inter-block time interval. The second builds atop this to simulate [selfish](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~ie53/publications/btcProcFC.pdf) and [stubborn](https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/796.pdf) mining attacks. The third assignment simulates a simple [payment channel network](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Payment_channels), and studies its behavior with time.

Each directory has its own corresponding `README` with more information about the corresponding assignment.
